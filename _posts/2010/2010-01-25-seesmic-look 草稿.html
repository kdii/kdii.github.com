The idea came to me when I was reviewing Neil Postman's<span class="mw-headline" id="Amusing_Ourselves_to_Death"><i><i> Amusing Ourselves to Death</i></i></span> days before. (Neil Postman also gave a speech named <a href="http://www.bigbrother.net/%7Emugwump/Postman/" target="_blank">Informing Ourselves To Death</a> at a meeting of the German Informatics Society in 1990, and that'll be a good topic for another blog). <br /><br />Postman wrote:<br /><br />"Television is....altering misplaced, irrelevant, fragmented or superficial information - information that creates the illusion of knowing something, but which in fact leads one away from knowing."<br /><br />Television is made up with moving pictures,&nbsp; <br /><br />Yesterday I read <span><a href="http://playpcesor.blogspot.com/2010/01/seesmic-look-twitter.html">異塵行者's blog</a>, got to know <a href="http://seesmic.com/seesmic_desktop">Seesmic Look</a></span> ,I was really excited that someone <br /><br /><br />http://playpcesor.blogspot.com/2010/01/seesmic-look-twitter.html<br />http://seesmic.com/seesmic_desktop/look/launch/<br /><br />http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Postman<br /><br />Television is altering the meaning of "being informed" by creating a species of information that might properly be called disinformation. Disinformation does not mean false information. It means misleading information - misplaced, irrelevant, fragmented or superficial information - information that creates the illusion of knowing something, but which in fact leads one away from knowing.<br /><br /><div class="post" id="post-711">      <h2><a href="http://www.fireandknowledge.org/archives/2006/05/20/television-is-hostile-to-conceptual-segmented-linear-modes-of-expression-postman/" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link: Television is hostile to conceptual, segmented, linear modes of expression (Postman)">Television is hostile to conceptual, segmented, linear modes of expression (Postman)</a></h2><div class="small">       May 20th, 2006 &nbsp;|&nbsp;        <!-- by Josh Sowin -->       Published in       <a href="http://www.fireandknowledge.org/archives/category/culture/" rel="category tag" title="View all posts in Culture">Culture</a>,  <a href="http://www.fireandknowledge.org/archives/category/education/" rel="category tag" title="View all posts in Education">Education</a>,  <a href="http://www.fireandknowledge.org/archives/category/quotes/" rel="category tag" title="View all posts in Quotes">Quotes</a>,  <a href="http://www.fireandknowledge.org/archives/category/television/" rel="category tag" title="View all posts in Television">Television</a>     <br /></div><div class="entry">       <blockquote>If we say that these industries only give our youth what they will pay for, the question remains, Why do our youth turn away from civilized speech?

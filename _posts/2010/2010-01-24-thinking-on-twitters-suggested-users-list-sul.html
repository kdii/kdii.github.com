  <div class="post"><div>Twitter has a Suggested Users List (SUL), which is for the new comer to get started in Twitter's following-followed game. The SUL has been critisized by lots of people since it's online. <br /><br /><blockquote>It created two levels of users, insiders and outsiders<br />It screwed with the integrity of every person and organization that was on the list, or who hoped to be on it.<br />It destroyed the value of the one potential metric for authority, follower count. <br /></blockquote><br />Dave Winer has <a href="http://www.scripting.com/stories/2010/01/22/twitterRevampsTheSulAddsAT.html">great posts</a> on the dilamma of the SUL. It seems Twitter is serious about the list and they update it now to a new one with categories.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://twittercism.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/twitter_suggestions.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="315" src="http://twittercism.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/twitter_suggestions.png" width="400" /></a><br /></div><br /><br />They use <a href="http://blog.twitter.com/2010/01/power-of-suggestions.html">certain algorithm</a> to generate the list , and try to make people believe that the list is fair, not controlled by human power or money power.<br /><br /><blockquote>We’ve created a number of algorithms to identify users across a variety of clusters who tweet actively and are engaged with their audiences. These new algorithms help us group these active users into lists of users by interests. Rather than suggesting a random set of 20 users for a new user to follow, now we let users browse into the areas they are interested in and choose who they want to follow from these lists.<br /></blockquote><br />The interesting thing is the algorithm is not open to the outside world, how can people believe it's a fair play without knowing the rule of the play?<br /><br />Since the SUL is definitely useful in many conditions, here are some ideas for the design:<br /><br />1, Make it a A-Z catalogue if Twitter insists on a catalogue UI. No one will question the A-Z algorithm.<br /><br />2, Patent the current algorithm behind the SUL and make it open to the outside。<br /><br />This is just like the Google's pagerank technology, people have less questions when they can query/understand the rule in a game.<br /><br />3, Make two lists. One is for people to pay to be there, the more they pay, the higher ranking they are on the list. The other list is either A-Z catalogue or list with algorithm open to the outside.<br /><br />The SUL is useful but I don't think it's as important as "<a href="https://twitter.com/invitations/find_on_twitter">Search user</a>" function on Twitter. Twitter should get more effort to improve the <a href="https://twitter.com/invitations/find_on_twitter">Search user</a>, just leave the SUL as simple as it is. Think about Google Directory and Google Search, you'll know what I mean.</div>

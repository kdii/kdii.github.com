  <div class="post"><h2>{{ page.title }}</h2><strong>{{ page.date | date_to_long_string }}</strong><div>Television is altering the meaning of "being informed" by creating a species of information that might properly be called disinformation.

It means misleading information - misplaced, irrelevant, fragmented or superficial information - information that creates the illusion of knowing something, but which in fact leads one away from knowing.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Postman#cite_note-ReferenceA-8"><span></span></a></div>
